The percent of improvement for test is better which is 59%. However, the percent of improvement for the training is worse which is -74%. It means that after I did the baseline predictor, it does not improve my user-item matrix. Here are the reasons the I guess. The set is a toyset which means I made them up so there are bias in the data set. Second of all, I think when I construct this data set, I put many NA values there. They exist in the reality but for a 5 by 5 matrix, it maybe too many of them.
